I chose the command `find` for this task. 
`find` is a command-line utility for finding files and directories based on various criteria, such as name, size, and modification time.

Here are interesting command-line options for `find`:

1. `-mtime` option: This option allows you to search for files based on their modification time.
   
   Example 1:

   Command: `find ./technical -mtime -7`
   Output: `./technical/code/script.py`
   
   Example 2:

   Command: `find ./technical -mtime +30`
   Output: `./technical/docs/report.pdf`
  
   This command will search for all files in the `./technical` directory and its subdirectories that have been modified within the last 7 days. This option can be useful when you want to find recently modified files. The website I used: https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Modified-Time.html

2. `-exec` option: This option allows you to execute a command on each file that matches the search criteria.
   
   Example 1:

   Command: `find ./technical -type f -name "*.py" -exec grep "python" {} \;`
   Output: `./technical/code/script.py:print("Hello Python!")`

   Example 2:

   Command: `find ./technical -type d -name "docs" -exec ls -l {} \;`
   Output:

   `./technical/docs:
   total 1
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 May 15 2023 report.pdf`
  
   This command will search for all files with a `.py` extension in the `./technical` directory and its subdirectories, and then search each file  for the word "python". This option can be useful when you want to perform an operation on all the files that match the search criteria. The website I used: https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Executing-Commands.html

3.  `-size` option: This option allows you to search for files based on their size.
   
      Example 1:

      Command: `find ./technical -type f -size +1M`
      Output: `./technical/code/script.py`

      Example 2:

      Command: `find ./technical -type f -size -100K`
      Output: `./technical/docs/report.pdf`
   
      This command will search for all files larger than 1 megabyte in the `./technical` directory and its subdirectories. This option can be useful when you want to find large files that are taking up disk space. The website I used: https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Size.html

4. `-type` option: This option allows you to search for files of a specific type.
      Example 1:
   
      Command: `find ./technical -type f -name "*.py"`
      Output: `./technical/code/script.py`

      Example 2:

      Command: `find ./technical -type d -name "docs"`
      Output: `./technical/docs`
  
      This command will search for all files with a `.py` extension in the `./technical` directory and its subdirectories. This option can be useful     when you want to search for files of a specific type and exclude directories. The website I used:        https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Type.html



In all of the above examples, the `./technical` directory was used as the search directory.
