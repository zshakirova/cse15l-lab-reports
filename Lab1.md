1. First step that I had to take was to install Visual Studio code. However, during the last quarter I was enrolled in CSE 8B and had already installed the app in the beggining of Winter quarter. The only thing I have to do now is to open VS code and new terminal.

2. The second step is remotely connecting. I entered "ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in the terminal. However, you ned to change "zz" to the unique letters that are attached to your account. Since it wasn't my first time it printed "(cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu) Password:". But when it's your first time remotely connecting, the computer will print "The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? ". You should answer yes.

You enter the password and then terminal prints this:

3. The third step is to try some of the commands. I tried command "ls -lat". The result looked should look like this:

Well done! Now, you knoiw how to use VS code, remotely connect, and use commands!
