a tutorial for incoming 15L students about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. 
1) the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like
2) For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did
3) you didn’t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).
