1. First step that I had to take was to install Visual Studio code. However, during the last quarter I was enrolled in CSE 8B and had already installed the app in the beggining of Winter quarter. The only thing I have to do now is to open VS code and new terminal. However if you don't have VS code installed you can visit this website: https://code.visualstudio.com. Follow the instructions and you'll be able to dowmload the app. Also there are different versions for macOS and Windows.

2. The second step is remotely connecting. Before this step, you need to access your account and reset the password. To access your CSE15L account, go to the website https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and search for your course-specific account. If you need help resetting your password, you can refer to a tutorial that explains the steps to do so. Here is the link to the tutorial: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view?usp=share_link.
3. In VS code you enter your unique code that loooks like this:"ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in the terminal. However, you ned to change "zz" to the unique letters that are attached to your account. To find it you need to go to this website: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php, enter your account name, PID. There you'll see "cs15lsp23zz".

5.  Since it wasn't my first time it printed "(cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu) Password:". But when it's your first time remotely connecting, the computer will print "The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? ". You should answer yes.

You enter the password and then terminal prints this:

3. The third step is to try some of the commands. I tried command "ls -lat". The result looked should look like this:

Well done! Now, you knoiw how to use VS code, remotely connect, and use commands!
